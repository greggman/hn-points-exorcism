# HN-POINTS-EXORCISM

A browser extension to remove the evil points from Hacker News

---

My personal opinion is that visible points are a net negative on Hacker News.
I know for me, even though I want to ignore them I can't get myself to do it.
If I notice my karma has gone up then I immediately want to know why. If I
notice my karma has gone down then I usually get upset. Conversely if they
leave a message, even if it's a rebuttal, I'm usually okay.

I'm not saying HN should get rid of voting, but I personally think they should
not display your karma or the votes on your comments. I think the world would
be a better place with less gamification, even HN's small amount.
